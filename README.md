# Welcome to the HaloArmory!

HaloArmory is a custom Garry's Mod addon created by @Norway174.

With many features, such as;
* Logistics System
* Vehicle Requisitions
* Persistent Ships
* Vehicle Cargo System
* ~~Character Persistence~~ (*Deprecated* - Check out: https://github.com)
* * ~~Character Creator~~
* ATC Radar (More to come soon!)
* ... And more!

For even more details, check out the Wiki: [HaloArmory/wiki](https://github.com/Norway174/HaloArmory/wiki)

## Requirements
**Supports ONLY [DarkRP](https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP).**  
[ULX](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557962280) is a soft dependency. You'll need it for some permissions related stuff.

**Please note:** This is not a 100% accurate list. This addon was made over a large time span, at a time when I didn't think I'd be releasing it. So the addon uses many random models from various Halo props packs. I am certain subscribing to all of these will stop any errors from occurring using this addon.

However, not all may be required.

### Optional Addons
These aren't strictly required. But they have special compatibility if included.  
(Mainly related to the vehicle cargo script.)
