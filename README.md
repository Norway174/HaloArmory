# Welcome to the HaloArmory wiki!

HaloArmory is a custom Garry's Mod addon created by @Norway174.
It offers a full suite of unique and fun additions to complement the HaloRP Gamemode.

Currently, the addon remains closed-source and available for use for only a select few servers;

* Ronin Networks: https://discord.gg/Nf6JF5sFS3 (Currently active.)
* Forward Unto Dawn: https://discord.gg/BZk6nFjRjt (Inactive, & no longer running.)


This repository serves as Documentation, Wiki, and Issue Tracker.

And in the future, will also host the source code when it's ready to be made public.
