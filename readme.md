# Welcome to the HaloArmory!

HaloArmory is a custom Garry's Mod addon created by @Norway174.  
It is a large suit of sort-of random and immersive features for the HaloRP gamemode for Garry's Mod.

With many features, such as;
* Logistics System
* Vehicle Requisitions
* Persistent Ships
* Vehicle Cargo System
* ATC Radar (More to come soon!)
* ... And more!

For even more details, check out the Wiki: [HaloArmory/wiki](https://github.com/Norway174/HaloArmory/wiki)

The old Character Persistence that was originally included in this has
been removed, and moved over to it's own standalone project here: [CharacterPersistence](https://github.com/Norway174/CharacterPersistence)

The AI module that was also included in this has been disabled, due to bugs with the old system. A new standalone project is being developed over here: [Aurora AI](https://github.com/Norway174/Aurora-AI)

The addon is available for download via the Steam Workshop for Garry's Mod.
